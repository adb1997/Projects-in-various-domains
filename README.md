A collection of independent projects on data science and IoT completed while pursuing an undergraduate major in Electrical Engineering.

### **---Home Automation---** 

IEEE certified IOT based Home Automation System is a project that encompasses today's technological advancements. I designed the web interface using HTML and CSS, added functionality through Jquery and lastly PHP to get things working. Using the XAMPP server for a local host I connected a Raspberry Pi Microcontroller flush with LEDs, DHT-11 sensor and HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to complete it. The web interface had buttons that can control the light, a meter reading the ambient temperature of the room and ultrasonic sensor tracking any illicit movements.

### **---Mini Scrabble---**

Python code randomly generates letters from which you can make words just like the game Scrabble. Each letter has an assigned score in a dictionary. Player can make as many words as they want until they have exhausted options. Compete against each other and highest score wins. 

Added functionality for the CPU to play the game autonomously as well. Watch the magic unfold ! 


### **---Backroom Inc---**

A project from the taskphase stage while applying for an internship in Data Science. The project folder contains R code for analysing the election data from the state of Karnataka, India. The task specifically required an analysis of the following to estimate an increment in probability of election: 

-Change in constituency
-Change in party 
-Consecutive or immediate recampaigning 

### **---Cipher---**

Contains Python code for Caesar cipher to encrypt/decrypt a given input text.
